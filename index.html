      A croissant is a buttery, flaky and delicious pastry that is a staple of
      French cusine. The dough is typically made with flour, water, yeast, salt,
      a small amount of suagr. After mixing the ingredients, the dough is a
      alloweTd to rest and rise before being rolled out. The key ingredient
      thatsets croissants apart from other pastries is the use of butter, which
      is layered into the dought during the rolling process. The butter is
      folded multiple times into the rolled dough creating layers of dough and
      butter. This process is known as lamination and is what gives the
      Croissants it's distinctive texture. The results is a light, airy texture
      with a golden-browm crust. Croissants can be enjoyed plain or filled with
      a vairety of ingredients such as chocolate, almond paste, jam and so on.
      They are often served for breakfast or as a snack with coffee or tea.
